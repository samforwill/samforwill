# Hi There! Welcome to my GitHub.

## About Me

I use data to support progressive campaigns and civic infrastructure. My work includes voter behavior modeling, precinct-level mapping, and demographic targeting using Python, SQL, and GIS. 

Based in Queens, always chasing better bike lanes.

## Take a look at some of my recent projects:

### [Party Support Model](https://github.com/samforwill/District-Insights)
Developed for the newly redistricted Congressional Districts following the 2020 Census, this model leverages the Census Bureauâ€™s 2021 American Community Survey data to predict Partisan Voter Index (PVI) scores with high accuracy for all US congressional districts. The accompanying [Streamlit app](https://2022midterms.streamlit.app) visualizes key demographic influences on PVI scores and simulates electoral outcomes based on different turnout scenarios.

### [Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tweet Analysis](https://github.com/samforwill/2024Strategies)
This project analyzes twitter messaging strategies from Democratic candidates who won difficult districts in the 2022 midterms. I used Non-Negative Matrix Factorization, NMF, and GloVe vector embeddings to uncover campaign strategies, such as Marie Gluesenkamp-Perez's focus on volunteer mobilization, and Chris Deluzio's strategy of tying his moderate opponenent to extreme figures. The insights from this analysis highlight tactical approaches that could influence election outcomes.

### [Geospatial Analysis of State Legislative Districts](https://github.com/samforwill/State-Legislative-Districts-PVI)
Employing demographic-based modeling, this project assesses the partisan leanings across state senate districts. Utilizing QGIS and GeoPandas, I mapped these leanings to visualize and predict electoral behaviors effectively.

Through these projects, I've honed my abilities to manipulate large datasets, develop predictive models, and present complex insights in accessible formats. My goal is to continue exploring how data science can be leveraged to enhance democratic engagement and inform better political decision-making to win elections.
